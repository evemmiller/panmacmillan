# Book Metadata Confirmation Check 
## Project Overview 
This project automates checks on editions to ensure that they are ready to be confirmed 12 months prior to publication. As part of the confirmation process, various metadata checks are conducted to ensure the completeness and comply with restrictions. The confirmation process also needs to account for different book formats and publication timelines, particularly ensuring that "Second Format" paperbacks do not undermine the sales of higher-priced "First Format" editions. This script takes a dataset of editions and carries out the following checks to determine if they should be confirmed or held back from the feed. 

### 1. **Edition Exclusion Check** 
Identifies Editions that should be excluded from confirmation. This includes: 
- Editions marked as embargoed. 
- Editions flagged as confidential.
- Editions currently under embargo
- Any additional exclusion indicators present in the dataset. 
### 2. **Work Status Check** 
Flags Editions that are not yet ready for confirmation due to their **Work Status**. Specifically: 
- Editions with a Work Status of **Pre-Acquisition** are identified, as they lack the necessary contracts and cannot be fed out. 
### 3. **Metadata Completeness Check** 
Ensures Editions have the necessary metadata for confirmation. Missing data in any of the following fields will be flagged: 
- **Extent** 
- **Format**
- **Price Sync Template** (for ebooks only) 
### 4. **Second Format Identification** 
Identifies paperback Editions that are **Second Formats**, i.e., those that publish after the "First Format" (Hardback, Trade Paperback, etc.). The script checks: 
- Whether the Edition is a Second Format.
- If it is, ensures that the Second Format's confirmation date is **6 weeks after** the First Formatâ€™s publication date to prevent undermining First Format sales. 
    
## Results
The script generates a report highlighting the Editions that: 
- Should not be confirmed due to exclusion flags or missing metadata. 
- Have a Work Status that prevents confirmation. 
- Are Second Format Editions and require feed date adjustments. This report can be reviewed by the line manager for further action before final confirmation decisions are made.

The results of the cleansing and analysis can be found [here](./publishing_data_results.csv)

633 second formats were identified and their earliest confirmation dates were confirmed to be at least 6 weeks after the publication of the first edition.

553 editions which should currently be excluded from confirmation were identified.

In these results you can see that each edition has a publication date and an earliest confirmation date. For most entries the confirmation date is a year prior to the publication date.

Under workref 50092 the paperback's earliest confirmation date is less than a year before its publication because it is a second format, and so can only be confirmed 6 weeks after the hardback is published.

Under workref 50088 the editions have a confirmation date, however it is currently maked as excluded from confirmation. The earliest confirmation date describes the earliest it could be confirmed, however this is only if the exclusion status changes before this time.

**Note** Binding was used to determine whether an edition is first of second format, however there are a large number of editions where the binding is NULL. Inspection of the data revealed these to primarily be ebooks and so were assumed not to be second formats. There were 25 where the binding was listed as NULL and the vistaformat is Paperback. These are treated as first editions but should be reviewed to ensure that their binding is correct
  
## How to Use 
1. **Prepare the Dataset:** 
- Ensure the [dataset](./panmacmillan_data.csv) containing book Edition information is correctly formatted, including ISBNs, Work Refs, and all relevant metadata fields. Note that data should be loaded with nulls for empty fields.
2. **Run the Script:** 
- Execute the [sql in the script](./macmillan_script1.sql) to perform the checks listed above. 
3. **Review the Output:** 
  Data has been analysed so that if isExcluded is False then the edition can be confirmed at the earliestConfirmationDate
- **Columns created by the script**
    - isExcluded
        - TRUE if the edition has been excluded from confirmation, embargoed for a later date, marked as confidential or given the status pre-Aquisition
        - NOTE - some embargo dates were listed in the confirmation notes and some in the edition embargoed until column
    - metadataIssues
        - True if there is missing data including
              a)	Extent
              b)	Format
              c)	Price Sync Template (for ebooks only)
          - Based on current assumptions editions have not been excluded from confirmation due to this data being missing but this can be updated if necessary.
    - isSecondFormat
        - True if a paperback has been identified as being a second format, based on the existence of a first edition with the same work reference
    - earliestConfirmationDate
        - The earliest date an edition can be confirmed assuming that it has not been excluded (see isExcluded)
        - For most editions this is a year prior to its publication dates
        - For second edition paperbacks this is either a year prior to its publication date or 6 weeks after the earliest first edition is published, whichever is later.

## Next Steps
- determining first and second editions
    - the data quality in the column 'binding' appeared to be the best for identifying Paperbacks, and therefore where paperbacks should be classified as second editions
    - there are a number of nulls in the 'binding' column, however upon reviewing the data these are primarily not related to physical books and so I felt comfortable excluding them in the identification of second editions as the primary concern was the affect of an early paperback release on sales of the hardbacks and trade paperbacks.
     - There are however 25 records where vistaformat is 'Paperback' but binding is null. This should be reviewed and updated if in error
 - Confirmation restriciton added has not been considered in the current analysis. If necessary this can be added to the script
 - Improvement of data quality in the confirmation notes. Currently confidential flags and some embargo dates were drawn from the confirmation notes. It would be beneficial to have a specific confidential flag and only include embargo dates in the EditionEmbargoedUntil column in order to prevent these confirmation restrictions from being missed.
 - Formal testing has not yet been run and should be before the data is used to establish confirmation dates
 - Automation of testing would be beneficial, particulary to ensure and confirmation restricitons are up to date
